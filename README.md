# Self-Assessment
## by Ami Cooper


### 1. Self-Assessment
`Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?`
* I think my primary deficiencies are confidence, a strong network to exploit, and some background technical knowledge. things like our first webpack template and our react template I feel like I can't really explain to someone why it's set up the way that it is or what all the individual pieces or plugins do and it makes me feel a bit self-conscious moving into the interview process. I guess I'm also worried because I think in comparison to the people in the cohort, I'm relatively average as far as skill and performance and that's not really a good feeling to go into a competitive market with.

* I also have a massive gap in my resume between Fall 2016 and now that I'm having a hard time explaining and it's definitely a sore point when moving into an interview.

* Also, not getting feedback or even an explicit rejection email. How do you know what to improve on a new application elsewhere? What stylistic choices or personal deficits get you thrown in the reject pile without any explanation? Not knowing and not being able to grow or improve from that makes it seem even more hopeless since there's no way to really gain any kind of forward momentum off of basically nothing.

`Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?`
* I don't think I feel that differently between a technical career or any other career in that I've had very little experience or success getting into either. It's definitely kind of scary being one of the younger people in the cohort and having to compete with people who were at their last jobs for twice as long as I was in college for. It's discouraging to grapple with the fact that getting a foothold in any industry seems straight up impossible from my perspective.

* I don't feel too bad when I try to solve problems and even whiteboarding doesn't seem as daunting as it did, and I think my use of terminology is appropriate and concise, but I wonder if it's actually good enough for me to get anywhere with it.

`Put careful thought into your answers, listing as many as apply to you and your situation. Do you have hesitations about the in-person interview process? Is MVC routing still a shaky subject for you? Is there a skill set you want to fine-tune before you'll feel totally ready to apply for jobs? Are you not yet confident in the cover letters or resumes you created yesterday? There's absolutely no wrong answers to these questions. Just be completely honest, yet gentle with yourself. What could be prevent you from hitting Send on an application, or walking into an internship or job interview with complete confidence?`
* I feel self-conscious about the idea of trying to sell myself as a React developer when we haven't even really touched React yet. I'm worried that I won't have enough time or practice with that library to really communicate any expertise with it by the time I need to actually start making a wage and paying off loans.

* I think it could be argued that I just don't feel like I meet the mark. In a vacuum or a comfortable space like the classroom, I feel fairly confident about what I know and being wrong, but when faced with the unknown and the potential for rejection, I can't tap into that at all.

* I worry that the narrative in my cover letters isn't cohesive enough and that it's just not compelling. I can't really see myself being more interesting than every other candidate.

### 2. Make a Plan
* Work on my cover letter, refine strengths and weaknesses.
  * outline a cohesive narrative
  * make sure that it highlights strengths
  * downplay weaknesses but don't totally omit them

* Get a therapist lmfao.
  * maybe when I have insurance lol.

* Spend a lot of time on React and refining personal projects.
  * add readme's to all pinned projects and other projects eventually
  * finish any incomplete pinned projects.
  * create and finish my portfolio site

### 3. Work
  * Review pinned repositories
  * update readme for study guide project

### 4. Set a Trajectory
Shortly before your 8 hours of work is complete, add a section called Reflection & Next Steps to your README containing answers to the following questions:

Do you feel like you made improvement today? Are you more confident and comfortable in one or more areas? Why or why not?

Where are you at now? What are your next steps? What do you still need to accomplish to feel confident and prepared to begin your eventual job search?

Inspiration and Examples
Not sure how to tackle your own areas for improvement? Here's some general examples to kickstart your own brainstorming and self improvement process:

If you struggle with your ability to write more algorithmic logic, sign up for a website with practice problems, such as HackerRank, and add screenshots of your progress to your project.

If you identify an area of core technical knowledge you should improve in before applying for jobs, create some project that demonstrates you have worked on something that shows this. Build an app whose theme is to demonstrate this.

If you won't feel fully comfortable and confident applying for jobs until your online presence is more developed, continue cleaning up your GitHub portfolio, and LinkedIn. Heck, maybe even start a blog or personal website to craft even more of an online presence for yourself.

If you need more time to write cover letters and resumes you feel really good about before you're fully comfortable applying for jobs, continue researching tips and tricks, and developing the materials you started in class yesterday.

If you have trouble networking or speaking, but know the future job title you want may require it, draft a plan for a lightning talk on a topic of your choice. Include your draft, written or sketched, in your project. Research where you can submit and deliver it as practice. Find a list of conferences and read through their schedules.

If there are specific technical skills you don't feel confident in, revisit our lessons and seek out additional outside resources or tutorials, follow along to build an example project, and/or create your own small application practicing these skills.

If you're uncertain what developer interviews look like, and this prevents you from being comfortable and confident, learn more about the process! Seek out videos, blog posts, and other resources that discuss professional developers' real live experiences interviewing, and hiring managers discussing what they look for in candidates.
