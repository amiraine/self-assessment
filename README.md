# Self-Assessment
## by Ami Cooper
First you must carefully assess which areas and skills you'll benefit from developing further. Create a repository with a README.md file. Add a section titled Self-Assessment. Include answers to these questions in this section and commit:

Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?

Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?

Put careful thought into your answers, listing as many as apply to you and your situation. Do you have hesitations about the in-person interview process? Is MVC routing still a shaky subject for you? Is there a skill set you want to fine-tune before you'll feel totally ready to apply for jobs? Are you not yet confident in the cover letters or resumes you created yesterday? There's absolutely no wrong answers to these questions. Just be completely honest, yet gentle with yourself. What could be prevent you from hitting Send on an application, or walking into an internship or job interview with complete confidence?

2. Make a Plan
Then, think critically about how you can address the areas identified in your answers. What work can you do to begin knocking down those barriers? Could you study up on a skill? Work on further refining your cover letter? Seek out resources with interview advice? Practice coding concepts by building another app?

Determine what steps you can take to further develop each area identified in your answers. Add a Plan section to your README. Add description or list outlining how you can work toward improving these areas, and commit.

3. Execute the Plan
After creating your plan, spend the remainder of the day working through it. You don't have to finish everything on your list, we only expect you to put in a solid day's work today. Add a README section called Work, and begin an ongoing list of tasks/activities you complete today, with their corresponding materials or content. Add to the list and commit periodically throughout the day.

What do we mean by "corresponding materials or content"? Just the tangible stuff associated with each activity. For instance, if you watched a YouTube tutorial series on interview tips, or an advanced technical concept, link it! If you researched and signed up for an event to help better network, include a screenshot of your ticket. If you built an app to help you practice, include the project in the repository. If you wrote a blog post or further refined your cover letters, include the text files here in your repository. You get the picture!

4. Set a Trajectory
Shortly before your 8 hours of work is complete, add a section called Reflection & Next Steps to your README containing answers to the following questions:

Do you feel like you made improvement today? Are you more confident and comfortable in one or more areas? Why or why not?

Where are you at now? What are your next steps? What do you still need to accomplish to feel confident and prepared to begin your eventual job search?

Inspiration and Examples
Not sure how to tackle your own areas for improvement? Here's some general examples to kickstart your own brainstorming and self improvement process:

If you struggle with your ability to write more algorithmic logic, sign up for a website with practice problems, such as HackerRank, and add screenshots of your progress to your project.

If you identify an area of core technical knowledge you should improve in before applying for jobs, create some project that demonstrates you have worked on something that shows this. Build an app whose theme is to demonstrate this.

If you won't feel fully comfortable and confident applying for jobs until your online presence is more developed, continue cleaning up your GitHub portfolio, and LinkedIn. Heck, maybe even start a blog or personal website to craft even more of an online presence for yourself.

If you need more time to write cover letters and resumes you feel really good about before you're fully comfortable applying for jobs, continue researching tips and tricks, and developing the materials you started in class yesterday.

If you have trouble networking or speaking, but know the future job title you want may require it, draft a plan for a lightning talk on a topic of your choice. Include your draft, written or sketched, in your project. Research where you can submit and deliver it as practice. Find a list of conferences and read through their schedules.

If there are specific technical skills you don't feel confident in, revisit our lessons and seek out additional outside resources or tutorials, follow along to build an example project, and/or create your own small application practicing these skills.

If you're uncertain what developer interviews look like, and this prevents you from being comfortable and confident, learn more about the process! Seek out videos, blog posts, and other resources that discuss professional developers' real live experiences interviewing, and hiring managers discussing what they look for in candidates.
