# Self-Assessment
## by Ami Cooper


### 1. Self-Assessment
`Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews?`
* I think my primary deficiencies are confidence, a strong network to exploit, and some background technical knowledge. things like our first webpack template and our react template I feel like I can't really explain to someone why it's set up the way that it is or what all the individual pieces or plugins do and it makes me feel a bit self-conscious moving into the interview process. I guess I'm also worried because I think in comparison to the people in the cohort, I'm relatively average as far as skill and performance and that's not really a good feeling to go into a competitive market with.

* I also have a massive gap in my resume between Fall 2016 and now that I'm having a hard time explaining and it's definitely a sore point when moving into an interview.

* Also, not getting feedback or even an explicit rejection email. How do you know what to improve on a new application elsewhere? What stylistic choices or personal deficits get you thrown in the reject pile without any explanation? Not knowing and not being able to grow or improve from that makes it seem even more hopeless since there's no way to really gain any kind of forward momentum off of basically nothing.

`Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process?`
* I don't think I feel that differently between a technical career or any other career in that I've had very little experience or success getting into either. It's definitely kind of scary being one of the younger people in the cohort and having to compete with people who were at their last jobs for twice as long as I was in college for. It's discouraging to grapple with the fact that getting a foothold in any industry seems straight up impossible from my perspective.

* I don't feel too bad when I try to solve problems and even whiteboarding doesn't seem as daunting as it did, and I think my use of terminology is appropriate and concise, but I wonder if it's actually good enough for me to get anywhere with it.

`Put careful thought into your answers, listing as many as apply to you and your situation. Do you have hesitations about the in-person interview process? Is MVC routing still a shaky subject for you? Is there a skill set you want to fine-tune before you'll feel totally ready to apply for jobs? Are you not yet confident in the cover letters or resumes you created yesterday? There's absolutely no wrong answers to these questions. Just be completely honest, yet gentle with yourself. What could be prevent you from hitting Send on an application, or walking into an internship or job interview with complete confidence?`
* I feel self-conscious about the idea of trying to sell myself as a React developer when we haven't even really touched React yet. I'm worried that I won't have enough time or practice with that library to really communicate any expertise with it by the time I need to actually start making a wage and paying off loans.

* I think it could be argued that I just don't feel like I meet the mark. In a vacuum or a comfortable space like the classroom, I feel fairly confident about what I know and being wrong, but when faced with the unknown and the potential for rejection, I can't tap into that at all.

* I worry that the narrative in my cover letters isn't cohesive enough and that it's just not compelling. I can't really see myself being more interesting than every other candidate.

### 2. Make a Plan
* Work on my cover letter, refine strengths and weaknesses.
  * outline a cohesive narrative
  * make sure that it highlights strengths
  * downplay weaknesses but don't totally omit them

* Get a therapist lmfao.
  * maybe when I have insurance lol.

* Spend a lot of time on React and refining personal projects.
  * add readme's to all pinned projects and other projects eventually
  * finish any incomplete pinned projects.
  * create and finish my portfolio site

### 3. Work
  * Review pinned repositories
  * update readme for study guide project
  * read some react lessons and decide to switch formats for my portfolio page so that i have one up and ready asap instead of building it with react.
  * initialize new webpack project for portfolio page
  * begin webpack project
  * attempt to make sticky navigation but failed, will add later.
  * create projects section
  * add sticky nav and profile section

### 4. Set a Trajectory / Reflection + next steps

  * I feel like I made some improvement as far as making headway with having a functional portfolio that I think looks good and does what it needs to. It was also a good exercise in functional programming as we will be doing in react because of the way that webpack loads and compiles images in its own directory which makes me feel a little more comfortable in approaching React.
  * with regards to the other things I mentioned, I don't think anything else really changed but at least I understand the general syntax of react better.
